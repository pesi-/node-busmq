Once a queue has no more clients attached, it will automatically expire\nafter a predefined ttl (also losing any messages in it).\n\n\nProducing Messages\n\uf0c1\n\n\nvar Bus = require('busmq');\nvar bus = Bus.create({redis: ['redis://127.0.0.1:6379']});\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  var q = bus.queue('foo');\n  q.on('attached', function() {\n    console.log('attached to queue');\n  });\n  q.attach();\n  q.push({hello: 'world'});\n  q.push('my name if foo');\n});\nbus.connect();\n\n\n\n\nConsuming Messages\n\uf0c1\n\n\nvar Bus = require('busmq');\nvar bus = Bus.create({redis: ['redis://127.0.0.1:6379']});\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  var q = bus.queue('foo');\n  q.on('attached', function() {\n    console.log('attached to queue. messages will soon start flowing in...');\n  });\n  q.on('message', function(message, id) {\n    if (message === 'my name if foo') {\n      q.detach();\n    }\n  });\n  q.attach();\n  q.consume(); // the 'message' event will be fired when a message is retrieved\n});\nbus.connect();\n\n\n\n\nConsumption Modes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are three modes that messages can be consumed from a queue, with various degrees of\nflexibility for each mode.\n\n\nUnreliable Delivery\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis is a \nZero-or-Once\n message delivery mode, which is also the default mode.\nMessages are consumed from the queue by one consumer only and will not be consumed again by that consumer or any other consumer.\nThis method of consumption is unreliable in a sense that if the consumer crashes before being able to\nhandle the message, it is lost forever.\n\n\n// consume with default settings\nq.consume();\n\n// this is the same as the default settings\nq.consume({reliable: false, remove: true});\n\n\n\n\nReliable Delivery (Guarantee Delivery)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis is a \nOnce-or-More\n message delivery mode, where it is guaranteed that messages will be delivered at least once.\nEvery consumed message enters a 'waiting for ack' state. The consumer should call 'ack' on a message in order to\nmark it as handled. When the client issues an 'ack' on the message, the message\nis permanently discarded from the queue and will not be consumed again.\n\n\nIf a client crashes when consuming in this mode, any messages that have not been ACKed will be delivered once more\nwhen a client starts to consume again.\n\n\nNote:\n This mode does not work well with multiple consumers. The behavior of multiple clients consuming in reliable\nmode from the same queue is undefined.\n\n\n// consume message reliably. message with id 3 is the last acked message\nq.consume({reliable: true, last: 3});\n\n\n\n\nPersistent Publish/Subscribe\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis is a form of publish/subscribe, where all consumers receive all messages, even if they were not consuming at the time messages were\nbeing pushed to the queue. A consumer can also specify the index of the message to start consuming from.\n\n\nThis is different than regular publish/subscribe since persistent publish/subscribe utilizes message queues to store\nevery published message, whereas regular publish/subscribe does not store published messages at any time.\n\n\nBe careful using Persistent publish/subscribe for long periods of time and many messages since the messages are stored\nin the queue for the entire existence of the queue. Misuse may lead to memory growth and an\neventual blowup of the redis server.\n\n\n// consume message without removing them from the queue. start consuming from message at index 0.\nq.consume({remove: false, index: 0});\n\n\n\n\nqueue.attach([options])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAttach to the queue. If the queue does not already exist it is created.\nOnce attached, the \nattached\n event is emitted.\n\n\nOptions:\n\n\n\n\nttl\n - duration in seconds for the queue to live without any attachments. default is 30 seconds.\n\n\ndiscoverable\n - whether this queue should notify all the federating buses connected to this bus about this queue. \n                   finding a discoverable queue is performed using the \nqueue.find#\n method. default is false.\n\n\n\n\nqueue.detach()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDetach from the queue. The queue will continue to live for as long as it has at least one attachment.\nOnce a queue has no more attachments, it will continue to exist for the predefined \nttl\n, or until it\nis attached to again.\n\n\nqueue.push(message[, callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPush a message to the queue. The message can be a JSON object or a string. \nThe message will remain in the queue until it is consumed by a consumer.\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n - the message to push\n\n\ncallback\n - invoked after the message was actually pushed to the queue. receives \nerr\n and the \nid\n of the pushed message\n\n\n\n\nqueue.consume([options])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStart consuming messages from the queue.\nThe \nmessage\n event is emitted whenever a message is consumed from the queue.\n\n\nOptions:\n\n \nmax\n if specified, only \nmax\n messages will be consumed from the queue. If not specified,\nmessages will be continuously consumed as they are pushed into the queue.\n\n \nremove\n - \ntrue\n indicates to remove a read message from the queue, and \nfalse\n leaves it in the queue so that it may be read once more. default is \ntrue\n.\n\nNote\n: The behavior of mixing consumers that remove messages with consumers that do not remove messages from the same queue is undefined.\n\n \nreliable\n - applicable only if \nremove\n is \ntrue\n. indicates that every consumed message needs to be ACKed in order not to receive it again in case of\ncalling \nconsume\n again. see \nqueue.ack\n for ack details. default is \nfalse\n.\n\n \nlast\n - applicable only if \nreliable\n is \ntrue\n. indicates the last message id that was ACKed so that only messages with higher id's should be received.\nif any messages still exist in the queue with id's lower than \nlast\n they will be discarded.\nthis behaves exactly like calling \nqueue.ack\n with the last id before starting to consume. default is 0.\n\n\nqueue.ack(id[, callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSpecifies that the message with the specified id, and all messages with lower id's, can safely be discarded so that\nthey should never be consumed again. Ignored if not consuming in reliable mode.\n\n\n\n\nid\n - the message id to ack\n\n\ncallback\n - invoked after the message was actually acked. receives \nerr\n.\n\n\n\n\nqueue.isConsuming([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nReturns \ntrue\n if this client is consuming messages, \nfalse\n otherwise.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - receives \nerr\n and the consuming state\n\n\n\n\nqueue.stop()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStop consuming messages from the queue.\n\n\nqueue.close()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCloses the queue and destroys all messages. Emits the \nclosed\n event once it is closed.\n\n\nqueue.flush([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEmpty the queue, removing all messages.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - invoked after the queue was flushed. receives \nerr\n.\n\n\n\n\nqueue.exists([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nChecks if the queue exists in the local bus.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - receives \nerr\n and \nresult\n with a value of \ntrue\n if the queue exists, \nfalse\n otherwise\n\n\n\n\nqueue.find([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nChecks if the queue already exists in the local bus or a federated bus. Note that a queue can only be found\nif the federated bus has announced its existence to the federating buses. This is something that happens periodically\nduring the lifecycle of the queue, where the frequency depends on the ttl of the queue.\nNormally this method would be called before calling \nqueue.attach\n.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - receives \nerr\n and the \nlocation\n of the queue. \n   if the queue exists locally, \nlocation\n will be set to \nlocal\n.\n   if the queue exists in a federated bus, \nlocation\n will be set to the url of the federated bus.\n   if the queue is not found, \nlocation\n is set to \nnull\n.\n\n\n\n\nqueue.count([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGet the number if messages in the queue.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - receives \nerr\n and the number of messages in the queue\n\n\n\n\nqueue.ttl([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGet the time in seconds for the queue to live without any attachments.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - receives \nerr\n and the ttl in seconds\n\n\n\n\nqueue.metadata(key [, value][, callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGet or set arbitrary metadata on the queue.\nWill set the metadata \nkey\n to the provided \nvalue\n, or get the current value of the key if the \nvalue\n parameter is not provided.\n\n\n\n\nkey\n - the metadata key to set or get\n\n\nvalue\n - [optional] the value to set on the key.\n\n\ncallback\n - receives \nerr\n as the first argument. if setting a metadata value, it is called with no further arguments.\nif retrieving the value, it is called with the retrieved value.\n\n\n\n\nqueue.pushed([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nReturns the number of messages pushed by this client to the queue\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - receives \nerr\n and the number of pushed messages\n\n\n\n\nqueue.consumed([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nReturns the number of messages consumed by this client from the queue\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - receives \nerr\n and the number of consumed messages\n\n\n\n\nQueue Events\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nattaching\n - emitted when starting to attach\n\n\nattached\n - emitted when attached to the queue. The listener callback receives \ntrue\n if the queue already exists\nand \nfalse\n if it was just created.\n\n\ndetaching\n - emitted when starting to detach\n\n\ndetached\n - emitted when detached from the queue. If no other clients are attached to the queue, the queue will remain alive for the \nttl\n duration\n\n\nconsuming\n - emitted when starting or stopping to consume messages from the queue. The listener callback will receive \ntrue\n\nif starting to consume and \nfalse\n if stopping to consume.\n\n\nmessage\n - emitted when a message is consumed from the queue. The listener callback receives the message as a string and the id of the message as an integer.\n\n\nerror\n - emitted when some error occurs. The listener callback receives the error.\n\n\n\n\nChannel\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA bi-directional channel for peer-to-peer communication. Under the hood, a channel uses two message queues,\nwhere each peer pushes messages to one queue and consumes messages from the other queue.\nIt does not matter which peer connects to the channel first.\n\n\nEach peer in the channel has a role. For all purposes roles are the same, except that the roles determine to which\nqueue messages will be pushed and from which queue they will be consumed. To peers to communicate over the channel, they must have opposite roles.\n\n\nBy default, a channel uses role \nlocal\n to consume messages and \nremote\n to push messages.\nSince peers must have opposite roles, if using the default roles, one peer must call \nchannel.listen\n and the other peer must call \nchannel.connect\n.\n\n\nIt is also possible to specify other roles explicitly, such as \nclient\n and \nserver\n.\nThis enables specifying the local role and the remote role, and just connecting the channel without calling \nlisten\n.\nSpecifying roles explicitly may add to readability, but not much more than that.\n\n\nA channel supports the same consumption modes as a queue does. See \nConsumption Modes\n for details.\n\n\nUsing a channel (default roles)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nServer endpoint:\n\n\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  var c = bus.channel('bar'); // use default names for the endpoints\n  c.on('connect', function() {\n    // connected to the channel\n  });\n  c.on('remote:connect', function() {\n    // the client is connected to the channel\n    c.send('hello client!');\n  });\n  c.on('message', function(message) {\n    // received a message from the client\n  });\n  c.listen(); // reverse the endpoint roles and connect to the channel\n});\n\n\n\n\nClient endpoint:\n\n\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  var c = bus.channel('bar'); // use default names for the endpoints\n  c.on('connect', function() {\n    // connected to the channel\n  });\n  c.on('remote:connect', function() {\n    // the server is connected to the channel\n    c.send('hello server!');\n  });\n  c.on('message', function(message) {\n    // received a message from the server\n  });\n  c.connect(); // connect to the channel\n});\n\n\n\n\nUsing a channel (explicit roles)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nServer endpoint:\n\n\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  // local role is server, remote role is client\n  var c = bus.channel('zoo', 'server', 'client');\n  c.on('connect', function() {\n    // connected to the channel\n  });\n  c.on('remote:connect', function() {\n    // the client is connected to the channel\n    c.send('hello client!');\n  });\n  c.on('message', function(message) {\n    // received a message from the client\n  });\n  c.connect(); // connect to the channel\n});\n\n\n\n\nClient endpoint:\n\n\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  // notice the reverse order of roles\n  // local role is client, remote role is server\n  var c = bus.channel('zoo', 'client', 'server');\n  c.on('connect', function() {\n    // connected to the channel\n  });\n  c.on('remote:connect', function() {\n    // the server is connected to the channel\n    c.send('hello server!');\n  });\n  c.on('message', function(message) {\n    // received a message from the server\n  });\n  c.connect(); // connect to the channel\n});\n\n\n\n\nchannel.connect()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nConnects to the channel. The \nconnect\n event is emitted once connected to the channel.\n\n\nchannel.attach()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlias to \nchannel.connect()\n\n\nchannel.listen()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nConnects to the channel with reverse semantics of the roles. \nThe \nconnect\n event is emitted once connected to the channel.\n\n\nchannel.send(message[, callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSend a message to the peer. The peer does need to be connected for a message to be sent.\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n - the message to send\n\n\ncallback\n - invoked after the message was actually pushed to the channel. receives \nerr\n and the \nid\n of the pushed message\n\n\n\n\nchannel.sendTo(endpoint, message[, callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSend a message to the the specified endpoint. There is no need to connect to the channel with \nchannel.connect\n or \nchannel.listen\n.\n\n\n\n\nendpoint\n - the target endpoint to receive the message\n\n\nmessage\n - the message to send\n\n\ncallback\n - invoked after the message was actually pushed to the channel. receives \nerr\n and the \nid\n of the pushed message\n\n\n\n\nchannel.disconnect()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDisconnect from the channel. The channel remains open and a different peer can connect to it.\n\n\nchannel.detach()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlias to \nchannel.disconnect()\n\n\nchannel.end()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEnd the channel. No more messages can be pushed or consumed. This also caused the peer to disconnect from the channel and close the message queues.\n\n\nchannel.ack(id[, callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSee \nqueue.ack\n for details\n\n\nchannel.isAttached([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nReturns \ntrue\n if connected to the channel, \nfalse\n if not connected.\n\n\nChannel Events\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nconnect\n - emitted when connected to the channel\n\n\nremote:connect\n - emitted when a remote peer connects to the channel\n\n\ndisconnect\n - emitted when disconnected from the channel\n\n\nremote:disconnect\n - emitted when the remote peer disconnects from the channel\n\n\nmessage\n - emitted when a message is received from the channel. The listener callback receives the message as a string.\n\n\nend\n - emitted when the remote peer ends the channel\n\n\nerror\n - emitted when an error occurs. The listener callback receives the error.\n\n\n\n\nPersistable\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIt is possible to persist arbitrary objects to the bus.\nA persistable object defines a set of properties on the object that are tracked for modification. When\nsaving a dirty object (where dirty means that some tracked properties have changed) only those dirty properties are\npersisted to the bus. Loading a persistable object reads all of the persisted properties.\n\n\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  var object = {field: 'this field is not persisted'};\n  var p = bus.persistify('obj', object, ['foo', 'bar', 'zoo']);\n  p.foo = 'hello';\n  p.bar = 1;\n  p.zoo = true;\n  p.save(function(err) {\n    // foo, bar and zoo fields have been saved\n  });\n\n  p.foo = 'world';\n  p.save(function(err) {\n    // only foo has been saved\n  });\n\n  // load the persistified properties\n  var p2 = bus.persistify('obj', {}, ['foo', 'bar', 'zoo']);\n  p2.load(function(err, exists) {\n    // exists == true\n    // p2.foo == 'world'\n    // p2.bar == 2\n    // p2.zpp == true'\n  });\n});\n\n\n\n\npersistable.save([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSave all the dirty properties. The dirty properties are marked as not dirty after the save completes.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - called when the save has finished. receives \nerr\n if there was an error.\n\n\n\n\npersistable.load([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLoad all the tracked properties. All properties are marked as not dirty after the load completes.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n  - called when the load has finished. receives \nerr\n, \nexists\n and \nid\n\nwhere \nexists\n is true if the persisted object was found in the bus and \nid\n is the id of the object whose data was searched.\n\n\n\n\npersistable.persist(ttl)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStart a periodic timer to continuously mark the persisted object as being used.\n\n\n\n\nttl\n specifies the number of seconds to keep the object alive in the bus.\n\n\n\n\npersistable.unpersist()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStop the periodic timer. This will cause object to expire after the defined ttl provided in the persist method.\n\n\nService\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA service endpoint for implementing microservice architectures.\n\n\nA service object can either be serving requests or making requests, but it can't do both.\n\n\nRequests to a service have the request/response form - a requester sends a request to the service, the service\nhandles the request and then sends a reply (or error) back to the requester.\n\n\nAny number of service objects can handle requests, as well as any mumber of clients \ncan make requests to the service. When there are multiple service objects serving the same service enpoint,\nonly one will ever receive any single request\n\n\nServices do not operate in reliable mode, that is, if a request is being handled but the service\nhandler crashes, the request is lost.\n\n\nMaking Requests\n\uf0c1\n\n\nvar Bus = require('busmq');\nvar bus = Bus.create({redis: ['redis://127.0.0.1:6379']});\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  // create a service object to make requests\n  var requester = bus.service('foo');\n  // connect to the service so we can make requests\n  requester.connect(function() {\n    console.log('connected to the service');\n  });\n  // make a request and receive a reply\n  requester.request({hello: 'world'}, function(err, reply) {\n    console.log('the service replied with ' + reply.thisis);\n  });\n  // this request does not have a reply\n  requester.request({hello: 'again'});\n});\nbus.connect();\n\n\n\n\nHandling Requests\n\uf0c1\n\n\nvar Bus = require('busmq');\nvar bus = Bus.create({redis: ['redis://127.0.0.1:6379']});\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  // create a service object to handle requests\n  var handler = bus.service('foo');\n  // handle requests\n  handler.on('request', function(request, reply) {\n    console.log('Hey! a new request just got in: ' + request.hello);\n    // send the reply back to the requester\n    reply(null, {thisis: 'my reply'});\n  });\n  // start serving requests\n  handler.serve(function() {\n    console.log('serving. requests will soon start flowing in...');\n  });\n});\nbus.connect();\n\n\n\n\nservice.serve([callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nStart serving requests made to the service. The \nrequest\n event will be fired when a new request arrives.\n\n\n\n\ncallback\n - one time listener for the \nserving\n event\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrequest\n event callback must have the form \nfunction(request, reply)\n where:\n\n\n\n\nrequest\n - the request data that the requester has sent\n\n\nreply\n - a function of the form \nfunction(err, reply)\n to send the reply back to the requester. \n            A service provider MUST invoke the \nreply()\n function to indicate the end of the request \n            processing even if no reply is sent back to the requester.\n\n\n\n\nservice.connect([options, callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nConnect to the service to start making requests.\n\n\n\n\noptions\n - connection options:\n\n\nreqTimeout\n - default request timeout for all requests\n\n\ncallback\n - one time listener for the \nconnected\n event\n\n\n\n\nservice.disconnect([gracePeriod])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDisconnect from the service. This should be called by both a service provider and a service consumer.\nWhen in serving mode, no new requests will arrive.\nWhen in requester mode, no new requests can be made.\n\n\n\n\ngracePeriod\n - number of milliseconds to wait for any currently in-flight requests to finish handling. \n\n\n\n\nservice.request(data[, options [, callback]]);\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMake a request to the service. The \nconnect()\n method must be called before making any requests.\n\n\n\n\ndata\n - the request data to send to the service. Can be a string or an object.\n\n\noptions\n - request options:\n\n\nreqTimeout\n - request timeout, overriding the default request timeout\n\n\ncallback\n - a callback of the form \nfunction(err, reply)\n that will be invoked with the reply from the service. \n               If ommitted, no reply will be sent (or received) from the service.\n\n\n\n\nService Events\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nserving\n - emitted when the service will start receiving \nrequest\n events\n\n\nconnected\n - emitted once connected to the service as a consumer\n\n\ndisconnected\n - emitted when disconnected from the service\n\n\nrequest\n - emitted when a request is received from a requester. The event handler should have the form \n(request, reply)\n, where \nrequest\n is the \n              data the requester sent, and \nreply\n is a function that the revice handler invokes once handling is done.\n\n\nerror\n - emitted when an error occurs. The listener callback receives the error.\n\n\n\n\nPublish/Subscribe\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA plain old publish/subscribe channel. These channels are not backed by queues, so any subscriber not subscribed at the\ntime a message is published will not receive the message.\n\n\nPublish/Subscribe channel are always created on the first redis server in the list of redis servers\nthe bus is connected to. The reason for this is the time it would take to locate a publish/subscribe channel via the\nredis api were the channels distributed between all redis servers (it's O(N) where N is the number of subscribers).\n\n\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  var s = bus.pubsub('my pubsub channel');\n  s.on('message', function(message) {\n    // received message 'hello world' on subscribed channel\n  });\n  s.subscribe();\n\n  var p = bus.pubsub('my pubsub channel');\n  p.publish('hello world');\n});\n\n\n\n\npubsub.publish(message[, callback])\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPublishes a message on the pubsub channel. Only currently subscribed clients will receive the message.\n\n\n\n\nmessage\n - the message to publish\n\n\ncallback\n - invoked after the message was actually published. receives \nerr\n if there was an error. \nnote: starting\nfrom version 1.5.0, the callback no longer receives the number of subscribers that received the message.\n\n\n\n\npubsub.subscribe()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSubscribes to message in the pubsub channel. Once a message is received, the \nmessage\n event will be emitted.\n\n\npubsub.unsubscribe()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUnsubscribes from messages on the pubsub channel. Messages can still be published using the \npublish\n method.\n\n\npubsub.isSubscribed()\n\uf0c1\n\n\nReturns \ntrue\n if subscribed to messages from the pubsub channel, \nfalse\n if not.\n\n\nPubsub Events\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nsubscribed\n - emitted when subscribed to messages on the pubsub channel\n\n\nunsubscribed\n - emitted when unsubscribing from the pubsub channel\n\n\nmessage\n - emitted when a message is received from the pubsub channel. The listener callback receives the message as a string.\n\n\nerror\n - emitted when an error occurs. The listener callback receives the error.\n\n\n\n\nFederation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIt is sometimes desirable to setup bus instances in different locations, where redis\nservers of one location are not directly accessible to other locations. This setup is very common\nwhen building a bus that spans several data centers, where each data center is isolated behind a firewall.\n\n\nFederation enables using queues, channels and persisted objects of a bus without access to the redis servers themselves.\nWhen federating an object, the federating bus uses web sockets to the target bus as the federation channel,\nand the federated bus manages the object on its redis servers on behalf of the federating bus.\nThe federating bus does not host the federated objects on the local redis servers.\n\n\nFederation is done over web sockets since they are firewall and proxy friendly.\n\n\nThe federating bus utilizes a simple pool of always-connected web sockets. When a bus is initialized, it\nspins up an fixed number of web sockets that connect to federated bus instances. When federating an object, the bus\nselects a web socket from the pool and starts federating the object over it.\n\n\nThe API and events of a federated objects are exactly the same as a non-federated objects. This is achieved\nusing the \ndnode\n module for RPCing the object API.\n\n\nOpening a bus with a federation server\n\uf0c1\n\n\n// this server is running on 192.168.0.1\nvar http = require('http');\nvar httpServer = http.createServer(); // create the http server to serve as the federation server. you can also use express if you like...\nhttpServer.listen(8881);\nvar Bus = require('busmq');\nvar options = {\n  redis: 'redis://127.0.0.1', // connect this bus to a local running redis\n  federate: { // also open a federation server\n    server: httpServer,  // use the provided http server as the federation server\n    secret: 'mysecret',   // a secret key for authorizing clients\n    path: '/my/fed/path' // the federation service is accessible on this path in the server\n  }\n};\nvar bus = Bus.create(options);\nbus.on('online', function() {\n  // the bus is now ready to receive federation requests\n});\nbus.connect();\n\n\n\n\nFederating a queue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nvar Bus = require('busmq');\nvar options = {\n  federate: { // connect to a federate bus\n    poolSize: 5, // keep the pool size with 5 web sockets\n    urls: ['http://192.168.0.1:8881/my/fed/path'],  // pre-connect to these urls, 5 web sockets to each url\n    secret: 'mysecret'  // the secret key to authorize with the federation server\n  }\n};\nvar bus = Bus.create(options);\nbus.on('online', function() {\n // federate the queue to a bus located at a different data center\n var fed = bus.federate(bus.queue('foo'), 'http://192.168.0.1:8881/my/fed/path');\n fed.on('ready', function(q) {\n   // federation is ready - we can start using the queue\n   q.on('attached', function() {\n     // do whatever\n   });\n   q.attach();\n });\n});\nbus.connect();\n\n\n\n\nFinding a queue\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIt is possible to find a queue that exists in a federated bus. \nNote that a queue can only be found if the federated bus has announced its existence to the federating buses. \nThis is something that happens periodically during the lifecycle of the queue, where the announcement frequency\n\ndepends on the ttl of the queue (frequency is ttl/3)\n\n\nMaking a queue discoverable\n\uf0c1\n\n\n // a queue named 'foo' is created in the federated bus at http://192.168.0.1:8881 and is made discoverable\n var queue = bus.queue('foo');\n queue.attach({discoverable: true});\n\n\n\n\nFinding the discoverable queue\n\uf0c1\n\n\n  // find the queue named 'foo'\n  var queue = bus.queue('foo');\n  queue.find(function(err, location) {\n    console.log(location === 'http://192.168.0.1:8881/my/fed/path');
